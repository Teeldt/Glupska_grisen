This is a computer version of the statistical game "Glupska Grisen".
It's also an experiment in which I've been trying to determine the ultimate
way of playing the game.

Turned out (after I simulated 500000 games of each strategy), that the answer is to sit
down as soon as the total has surpassed 21. That gives an average of 97.77554 points per round.
